Setting up Mezzanine for make_school

1. Follow the quick start on the Mezzanine site:
http://mezzanine.jupo.org

mezzanine-project make_school
cd make_school
python manage.py createdb
-I created a default account, and accepted some of the defaults on the database creation.

# Almost the first thing we do in Open Source projects is to create the public 
# source code repository!
#Add to github (details on setting up a github account and setting up ssh keys
#are left as an excercise to the reader :-):
#created repository make_school  on github.com
created README.md in our project

#In make_school directory
git init
git add README.md
git commit -m "first commit"
git remote add origin git@github.com:RichGibson/make_school.git
git push -u origin master


#then did git add for the rest of the site

#Here is the basic workflow...
# make changes, then:
git add <files>
git commit -m "commit message"
git push origin master

For the devlopement server I had to add a firewall rule to open port 8080:
iptables -A INPUT -p tcp -d 0/0 -s 0/0 --dport 8080 -j ACCEPT

Start the development server:
python ./manage.py runserver 144.76.17.54:8080
