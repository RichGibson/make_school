make_school

A Mezzanine project to support Project Make at Analy High School, and in theory
it can be used for other maker classes in schools or other spaces.

Aspirationally it (will) provide tools to display projects, help build SBU's
(safety and basic use instructions for tools), and generally do Good Things.
